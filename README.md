### Guide to creating files

1. Components should be in jsx format (App.js/index.js are exceptions)
2. Store shared components in the shared folder eg.Navbar (dir: src>components>shared)
3. CSS only store global css styles in the App.css file, custom css should be stored respectively in the styles folder based on your component name. (dir: src>styles)
4. Store hardcoded variables/ strings into the constants components.
